Code Explanation: 

1. HTML
Header Section: Includes the main heading, hero image, feature list,  call-to-action(CTA) button, and guarantee note.
Section Blocks: Each section has a text and image block side by side to match the mockup.

All styling is separated into an external CSS file for clarity and maintainability.
Utilises Flexbox for layout, media queries for responsiveness, and maintains consistent padding, colour, and typography.
Custom button and image styles ensure visual alignment with the design.
